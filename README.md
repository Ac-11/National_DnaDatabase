# National_DnaDatabase
A DNA database, also known as a DNA databank, is a collection of DNA 
profiles that can be used for genetic disease study, criminal justice applications 
of genetic fingerprinting, and genetic genealogy.
Use Case:
In many cases where a dead body is in a bad condition and is not identified the 
case gets closed in 72 hours. If we have a national DNA database then we can 
identify the dead body by matching his DNA with his existing DNA profile
collected and stored in the database earlier. Once the victim is identified then it 
will be easy to get hints about the accused.
Advantages of a DNA database:
1. It can add another line of support to the evidence.
An individual's DNA can be used to prove their presence at the site of a crime 
when there are no eyewitnesses. Researchers can check acquired samples against 
historical data using a DNA database to see if any matches exist. The case against 
a suspect gets significantly stronger if there is a match. Because an accurate match 
can offer such high degrees of assurance, the existence of a DNA database aids in 
the prevention of crime.
2. Rates of crime decrease are possible.
DNA databases can aid in reducing crime in areas where repeat offenders exhibit 
criminal behaviours.
3. Studies on genetics can be made using the information.
There are already some genetic research projects that employ DNA databases. 
When there are near matches to previously recorded DNA profiles, they are also 
used to aid in locating genetic relations. Although this information might be 
sensitive, particularly if a law enforcement emphasis is placed on it, it can also be 
used to advance our understanding of what it means to be a person. We can fix 
mistakes that these fundamental components of life may make for some people if 
we have a better understanding of our DNA.
Possible Outcomes:
We can use this database for research and medical needs in addition to criminal 
cases. US, UK, Canada, Malaysia, South Africa and Australia, and around 70 
more countries have DNA data banks. This aids in the investigation of criminal 
cases and the quickening of justice. India will take part in it as well.
